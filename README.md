3) On your calculator, press [PRGM], then find HPAINT and press [ENTER] twice to start HousePaint.

# How to play

The object of the game is to paint every square in each level. Use your arrow keys to control the square, but remember, your square won't stop moving until it hits a wall. Even if a level looks hard, there's no impossible level. If you find yourself trapped or otherwise unable to finish the level, or you're just done with the game, you can press [CLEAR] to exit the level and go back to the Menu. If you re-enter the level after you return to the menu, your progress within that level will not be scored, and new level will take its place.
